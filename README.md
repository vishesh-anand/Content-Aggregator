# Content Aggregator
When we look for something on Search Engine/Internet, we get a lot of search results and it is really tiring to go through all of the content, so why not we create an application which sorts and displays the required content according to our requirements.
This Content Aggregator fetches required information or content all over the internet, sorts and displays the required content according to our requirements.
It saves your time of searching some information on different websites because it shows all the information you need from different source at one place.
**Language :** *Python*
